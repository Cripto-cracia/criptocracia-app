  **Criptocracia: Experimental, trustless open-source electronic voting system**.

  The critical need for secure, transparent, and anonymous electronic‑voting systems is becoming ever more pressing, especially in settings where trust in central authorities is limited—addressing concerns that authoritarian regimes may use electoral systems to stay in power. The historical challenges of electoral fraud underscore the importance of exploring robust solutions. Modern cryptography provides powerful tools for building systems that can withstand manipulation and allow for public verification.

  **Why You Need It:**
  - **Vote Secrecy/Anonymity:** Voter choices must remain hidden from the Electoral Commission (EC) and third parties.
  - **Voter Authentication:** Only eligible voters, identified by their Nostr public keys, are eligible to participate.
  - **Vote Uniqueness:** Each voter may cast only one valid vote.
  - **Verifiability/Auditability:** The electoral process and results must be publicly verifiable without compromising the identity of the voter, minimizing the trust required in the central tallying authority. (This central tallying authority may be comprised of a committee composed of a representative from each voting option.)
  - **Nostr's Role:** Nostr is proposed as the underlying communication layer. Its decentralized, public/private event-based features can be used for both vote transmission and the implementation of a public bulletin board. Features such as NIP-59 Gift Wrap are used to encrypt data during transmission, protecting the confidentiality of the vote in transit.
